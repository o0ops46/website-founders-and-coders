      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <h3>Just an orinary guy, passionate about technology.</h3>
      <p>
        I came in the UK in 2015 and by luck a company hired and trained me six
        years ago to fit smart meters inside domestic properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very interested in web development and have been self-learning
        through various platforms like The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, and
        Udemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that a career as a web developer would allow me to help more
        people in a different way and I'm excited about the potential to create
        websites and applications that make a difference.
